## 1. Data Structure 
The `Exam_Reader` is responsible for parsing multiple-choice exams into the data structure outlined below. For each loaded file, an `Exam_Reader` object is created, containing the following data, which is stored in a hashmap.

As a data structure, this is quite extensive. Some might argue that it uses a lot of memory and that the purpose of `Exam_Reader` could be achieved with less data.

I agree with that point; however, I chose this data structure so that an `Exam_Reader` object can be used for both the `Exam_Randomizer` and the `Exam_Scorer`. If I had used a different object for the `Exam_Scorer` than for the `Exam_Randomizer`, I would have had to write methods twice, which would lead to code redundancy.

Another advantage of using such a large data structure is that it simplifies querying. For example, for the `Exam_Randomizer`, I could easily query the corresponding line from `Exam_Reader` and write it to the output file without worrying about spaces, etc. To compare two exams, I used the normalized version of questions and answers. To neatly print these to the console, I retrieved their pretty versions.

## 2. Fuzzy Matching 
To evaluate the completed multiple-choice exams, the marked answers must be compared with the correct answers from the master file. There were instances where some of the completed multiple-choice exams deviated from the original template, for example, when some words in a question were written differently.

To help `Exam_Scorer` recognize such deviations from the original, the questions and answers were simplified. First, the strings were normalized using the following steps:

1. Removes brackets (answers) or numbers (questions).
2. Removes leading and trailing spaces.
3. Removes line breaks.
4. Replaces multiple spaces between words with a single space.
5. Converts all characters to lowercase.
6. Removes stop words.

For example:
```
"    [ ] To throw away my computer\n" becomes "throw away computer" in the normalized form.
```

To allow similar questions or answers to be accepted, the original and the deviation were compared using the Levenshtein distance. The Levenshtein distance measures how many single-character editsâ€”insertions, deletions, or substitutions are required to transform one string into another.

The deviation was accepted if the edit distance was less than or equal to 10% of the length of the original string.

For example:
```
"today date#" is accepted as "today date:"
```

However, this type of matching also has disadvantages. For instance, a slightly different answer could be accepted even if it is actually incorrect and happens to match another incorrect answer option.
 
## 3. Collusion Detection 
The collusion detection mechanism compares the incorrect answers of a student with those of their peers to estimate the likelihood of cheating. The algorithm begins by identifying how many questions a student answered incorrectly and then checks whether any of these incorrect answers match with those of other students.

The probability of cheating is determined by the ratio of matching incorrect answers to the total number of incorrect answers. If this probability exceeds 50%, and the student has a sufficient number of wrong answers relative to the total questions, the student is flagged for potential cheating.

The formula for calculating the probability is:
```latex
P = \left( \frac{I}{W} \right) \times 100
```

\( I \) is the number of identical incorrect answers,  
\( W \) is the total number of incorrect answers given by the student,  
\( P \) is the calculated probability as a percentage.
